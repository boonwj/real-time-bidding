    abstract = {We describe a new Bayesian click-through rate (CTR) prediction algorithm used for Sponsored Search in Microsoft’s Bing search engine. The algorithm is based on a probit regression model that maps discrete or real-valued input features to probabilities. It maintains Gaussian beliefs over weights of the model and performs Gaussian online updates derived from approximate message passing. Scalability of the algorithm is ensured through a principled weight pruning procedure and an approximate parallel implementation. We discuss the challenges arising from evaluating and tuning the predictor as part of the complex system of sponsored search where the predictions made by the algorithm decide about future training sample composition. Finally, we show experimental results from the production system and compare to a calibrated Na\"{\i}ve Bayes algorithm.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.7073},
	abstract = {Being an emerging paradigm for display advertising, Real-Time Bidding (RTB) drives the focus of the bidding strategy from context to users' interest by computing a bid for each impression in real time. The data mining work and particularly the bidding strategy development becomes crucial in this performance-driven business. However, researchers in computational advertising area have been suffering from lack of publicly available benchmark datasets, which are essential to compare different algorithms and systems. Fortunately, a leading Chinese advertising technology company iPinYou decided to release the dataset used in its global RTB algorithm competition in 2013. The dataset includes logs of ad auctions, bids, impressions, clicks, and final conversions. These logs reflect the market environment as well as form a complete path of users' responses from advertisers' perspective. This dataset directly supports the experiments of some important research problems such as bid optimisation and CTR estimation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first publicly available dataset on RTB display advertising. Thus, they are valuable for reproducible research and understanding the whole RTB ecosystem. In this paper, we first provide the detailed statistical analysis of this dataset. Then we introduce the research problem of bid optimisation in RTB and the simple yet comprehensive evaluation protocol. Besides, a series of benchmark experiments are also conducted, including both click-through rate (CTR) estimation and bid optimisation.},

abstract = {We use data from a large-scale field experiment to explore what influences the effectiveness of online advertising. We find that matching an ad to website content and increasing an ad's obtrusiveness independently increase purchase intent. However, in combination, these two strategies are ineffective. Ads that match both website content and are obtrusive do worse at increasing purchase intent than ads that do only one or the other. This failure appears to be related to privacy concerns: the negative effect of combining targeting with obtrusiveness is strongest for people who refuse to give their income and for categories where privacy matters most. Our results suggest a possible explanation for the growing bifurcation in Internet advertising between highly targeted plain text ads and more visually striking but less targeted ads.},

	abstract = {Real-time bidding (RTB) has become one of the largest online advertising markets in the world. Today the bid price per ad impression is typically decided by the expected value of how it can lead to a desired action event (e.g., registering an account or placing a purchase order) to the advertiser. However, this industry standard approach to decide the bid price does not consider the actual effect of the ad shown to the user, which should be measured based on the performance lift among users who have been or have not been exposed to a certain treatment of ads. In this paper, we propose a new bidding strategy and prove that if the bid price is decided based on the performance lift rather than absolute performance value, advertisers can actually gain more action events. We describe the modeling methodology to predict the performance lift and demonstrate the actual performance gain through blind A/B test with real ad campaigns in an industry-leading Demand-Side Platform (DSP). We also discuss the relationship between attribution models and bidding strategies. We prove that, to move the DSPs to bid based on performance lift, they should be rewarded according to the relative performance lift they contribute.},
